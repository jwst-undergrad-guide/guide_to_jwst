# JWST Undergraduate Guide Jupyter Notebooks

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Unless otherwise noted (like with jdavis), always start by activating the jwst environment you have created (instructions in pipeline doc), or selecting it as the Jupyter kernel.

We've created this ``guide_to_jwst`` repository to host several Jupyter notebooks that serve to supplement our written JWST Undergraduate Guide. The hope is that these notebooks will help undergrads and even their advisors to get started from ground zero with JWST, facilitating more research opportunities in the undergrad space using JWST.

## Notebooks

The following notebooks are included in the repository, and may be downloaded and used individually or cloned as a whole repository.
